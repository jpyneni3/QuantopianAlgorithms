## Algorithm Explanations

|  File Name   | Algorithm Explanations | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| ManualStrategy.py | Uses combination of MACD signal and Bollinger Bands| This was done to understand nuances of Quantopian. Algorithm is based off algorithm developed for 4646 in my other repository|
| RandomForestClassifier.py | Uses Random Forrest Classifer to predict based off last 10 days of data | Used an online algorithm to see how ML could be used in Quantopian|
